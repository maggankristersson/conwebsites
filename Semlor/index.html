        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>The origins of semlor can be traced back to medieval times, when they were a simple bun made of flour and water. Over time, they became a symbol of wealth and luxury, as richer ingredients such as milk and butter were added. Today, they are a beloved Swedish tradition.</p>

        <h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
        <p>Here is a simple recipe for semlor:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add warm milk and melted butter to the bowl, and stir until the dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-15 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, until it has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough balls and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Brush the tops of the dough balls with beaten egg, and bake them in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until they are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the buns cool completely before slicing off the tops and scooping out some of the inside to make room for the almond paste and whipped cream filling.</li>
            <li>Mix together almond paste, sugar, and milk to make the filling, and spoon it into the buns. Top with whipped cream and replace the tops of the buns.</li>
        </ol>
