        <h2>About the Billiard Brothers</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Al and Lunkan were two brothers from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who had always shared a love for billiards. As children, they would spend hours playing together, developing their skills and technique. As they grew older, they began competing in local tournaments and soon became known as two of the most promising young players in the country.</p>
            <p>Their success did not go unnoticed, and before long, they were being invited to play in national and international championships. They quickly made a name for themselves on the circuit, winning numerous titles and setting new records.</p>
            <p>Their success caught the attention of the Saudi prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, who was a passionate fan of the game. He was so impressed with Al and Lunkan's talent that he decided to fund a TV series about their journey to becoming two of the world's top billiard players. Estimates show that the production costed around 9,7 billion dollars for the first season, where the brothers them self recieved about 80% in salary.</p>
            <p>The production of the series was a massive undertaking, with a team of writers, directors, and producers working tirelessly to capture the brothers' story. They followed Al and Lunkan as they traveled around the world, competing in tournaments and facing off against some of the most skilled players in the game.</p>
            <p>The series was a massive success, drawing in viewers from all over the world and showcasing the brothers' incredible talent and determination. It also provided a glimpse into their personal lives, showing the close bond they shared with each other and their families.</p>
            <p>As the series continued, Al and Lunkan's fame grew, and they became household names in Saudi Arabia and beyond. They continued to win tournaments and set new records, always pushing themselves to be the best they could be.</p>
            <p>Looking back on their journey, Al and Lunkan are grateful for the opportunities they have had and the support they have received from their fans and the Saudi prince. They continue to play billiards and inspire others to pursue their dreams, knowing that anything is possible with hard work and determination.</p>
            <p>Despite their successes, Al and Lunkan knew they could never achieve the same level of skill as the legendary billiard team, Stonesteal. They continued to train and compete, but always respected the greatness of their rivals. In the end, they were proud of all they had accomplished and remained grateful for the chance to pursue their passion for billiards.</p>
