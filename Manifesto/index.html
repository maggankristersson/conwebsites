                Urban had lived alone on the mountain for over 50 years, and in that time, he had learned everything there was to know about being a con man. He knew how to manipulate people, how to deceive them, and how to get what he wanted. When he finally came down from the mountain and entered the nearby village, he was shocked at what he saw. The people in the village were simple, and they lacked the street smarts and cunning that Urban possessed.
                In the town square, Urban addressed the villagers, calling them losers and telling them that they were easy targets for anyone who wanted to take advantage of them. He spoke passionately about the art of the con, and he urged the villagers to embrace their inner con artist. He told them that if they wanted to be successful, they needed to learn how to lie, cheat, and steal.
                The villagers were appalled by Urban's words, but they couldn't deny that he was a charismatic speaker. As he continued to talk, some of the villagers began to see the appeal of his message. They started to believe that they too could become the perfect con man, just like Urban. And as they left the town square that day, they couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and possibility about their newfound skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Just as the last villager left the town square, a strange figure appeared before Urban. It was Socrates, the ancient philosopher, who had come back to life to challenge Urban's ideas.
                Socrates asked Urban, "Why do you believe that the path to success is through deception and theft? Is there not a better way to live and to treat your fellow human beings?"
                Urban responded, "Socrates, you are a relic of a bygone age. The world has changed, and those who are not willing to adapt will be left behind. Deception and theft are the tools of the successful, and only those who are willing to use them will survive in this world."
                Socrates shook his head. "You are mistaken, my friend. There is a higher path, a path of honesty and virtue. The pursuit of wealth and power at any cost will only lead to destruction in the end. What kind of legacy will you leave behind if all you have accomplished is to deceive and manipulate others?"
                Urban laughed at Socrates' words. "You are a dreamer, Socrates. The world is not so simple. Those who play by the rules are doomed to fail. Only those who are willing to take what they want by any means necessary will succeed."
                Socrates and Urban continued to argue, each presenting their own point of view. Socrates argued that the pursuit of honesty and virtue was the only way to live a meaningful life. Urban countered that such a path was naive and unrealistic, and that the only way to get ahead in the world was through deception and theft.
                As the debate continued, the villagers watched on, torn between the two men's perspectives. Many of them had been taken in by Urban's words and believed that he was the only one who truly understood how the world worked. But as Socrates continued to speak, some of the villagers began to question whether there was a better way to live.
                In the end, the debate ended in a stalemate. Urban and Socrates went their separate ways, each convinced that their own path was the right one.

                <br>
                Urban decided to pursue his con dream by creating a secret society and writing a book on how to con. After the debate with Socrates, Urban returned to his mountain home with a renewed sense of purpose. He spent months working on his book, pouring all of his knowledge and experience into its pages. He also began to recruit members for his secret society, searching for like-minded individuals who were willing to embrace the art of the con.
                As word of Urban's society spread, more and more people began to join. They came from all walks of life, from the wealthy elite to the poorest of the poor. What they all shared was a desire to succeed, no matter the cost.
                Urban taught his members everything he knew about the art of the con, from how to read body language to how to forge documents. He emphasized the importance of secrecy and trust, and warned his members that any breach of either would result in severe consequences.
                As the society grew, Urban became increasingly powerful. He had a network of loyal followers who would do anything he asked, and he used them to carry out some of the biggest cons in history. From elaborate Ponzi schemes to simple confidence tricks, Urban's society was responsible for millions of dollars in stolen wealth.

                <br>
                While Socrates didn't return to join Urban's secret society, he did continue to watch from afar as Urban's power grew. He saw the devastation that Urban's cons caused, and he knew that something needed to be done to stop him.
                Socrates decided to take action by writing a book of his own, one that offered a different perspective on how to live a meaningful life. In his book, Socrates emphasized the importance of virtue, honesty, and humility, and he argued that true success could only be achieved through hard work and dedication.
                The book became a flop, and Socrates slowly started to fade away into obscurity. As Urban's secret society continued to grow in size and power, he began to take more pride in his appearance. He decided to grow a beard, which he believed would give him a more distinguished look and make him appear more authoritative.
                However, Urban quickly discovered that growing a beard was not as easy as he had thought. He struggled to maintain it and keep it looking neat and well-groomed. So he sought out the help of a local barber, who became one of his most trusted confidants.
                The barber not only took care of Urban's beard but also helped him to craft a new image for himself. He recommended different styles of clothing that would make Urban look more sophisticated and influential. He also taught Urban how to use certain grooming products to keep his beard looking its best.
                As Urban's beard grew longer and more impressive, he became even more confident and commanding. He used his appearance to his advantage, using it as a tool to intimidate and impress those around him.
                Over time, Urban became known as the "Bearded Con Man," and his beard became a symbol of his power and success. His followers admired him for his confidence and ability to manipulate others, and they emulated his style in the hope of achieving similar success.
                Despite Socrates' warnings, Urban continued to lead his secret society and carry out elaborate cons. He became one of the most infamous con men in history, and his legacy continued long after his death". Even today, people still study his techniques and use them to swindle others out of their money.

                As the research continued, NASA made the decision to expand the satellite laboratory, dedicating it solely to the study of Urban's beard hair. They sent additional scientists and resources to the satellite to assist in the research. The team was able to map out the entire genetic makeup of Urban's beard, and they quickly realized that he had the world's greatest beard genetics.
                The team of scientists was overjoyed with their discovery, and they quickly shared their findings with the rest of the world. Urban became an overnight sensation, and people from all over the world came to see his impressive beard in person.
                As for NASA, they continued to conduct research on Urban's beard hair for years to come. They used the knowledge they gained to make significant advances in the field of human genetics. The satellite laboratory, which was once dedicated solely to the study of Urban's beard hair, became a hub of scientific discovery and innovation, helping to pave the way for future breakthroughs in human genetics.
